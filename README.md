# Sorting_Visualizer
Visualization of Sorting Algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.

A sorting algorithm is a method that arranges the elements of a list into a specific order. Although numerous sorting algorithms exist, only a few are widely used in practical implementations due to their efficiency and effectiveness. In this project, we will create a sorting visualizer using the SDL2 Library in C++. This visualizer will help us understand the functioning of several key sorting algorithms by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.

Our sorting visualizer will demonstrate the workings of the following sorting algorithms:

1.Selection Sort /n
2.Insertion Sort
3.Bubble Sort
4.Merge Sort
5.Quick Sort
6.Heap Sort

The visualizer will handle a fixed list size of 130 elements. Users will have the ability to randomize the list and choose any of the aforementioned sorting algorithms to apply. Each algorithm will sort the elements in ascending order.

It is important to note that the visual representation of sorting times in this project does not accurately reflect the true time complexities of the algorithms. To ensure that faster algorithms such as Merge Sort are properly visualized, we have introduced deliberate delays. This allows users to better observe and understand the sorting process for each algorithm, even those that typically operate at higher speeds.

Through this visualizer, users can gain a deeper understanding of how different sorting algorithms operate and how they compare to each other in terms of efficiency and complexity.
