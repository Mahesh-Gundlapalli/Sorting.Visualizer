# Sorting_Visualizer
Visualization of Sorting Algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library
A sorting algorithm is a method that arranges the elements of a list into a specific order. Although numerous sorting algorithms exist, only a few are widely used in practical implementations due to their efficiency and effectiveness. In this project, we will create a sorting visualizer using the SDL2 Library in C++. This visualizer will help us understand the functioning of several key sorting algorithms by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.
